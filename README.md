# hello-world
Gidds' First Repository

Well in short I want to learn coding. I want to understand it better and be able to make and develop new programs, extensions ect.

I matriculated with C++ Knowledge but didnt code for 3 years and now im back and started learning C#, Python and Swift. I own Apple Products as they work for me and do what I need done.
